# CxC-2025

This is an example repository that you should refer to when submitting your project files. Your repository should be in the same structure and format as this example respository. Please feel free to ask any mentors or organizers if you have any questions, or ping in Discord. 

Note: You/your team only have to create Challenge Submission Folders (CSFs) for the challenges that you/your team participated in. So, if you/your team only participated in the SAP and
Federato challenges, you/your team would only have a SAP CSF and a Federato CSF in your Submission Repository. Or, if you/your team participated in all 4 of the challenges, then 
you/your team's Submission Repository will have 4 CSFs.
